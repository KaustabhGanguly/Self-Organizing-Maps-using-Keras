Self Organizing Map(SOM) by Teuvo Kohonen provides a data visualization technique which helps to understand high dimensional data by reducing the dimensions of data to a map. SOM also represents clustering concept by grouping similar data together. Therefore it can be said that SOM reduces data dimensions and displays similarities among data.
With SOM, clustering is performed by having several units compete for the current object. Once the data have been entered into the system, the newtwork of artificial neurons is trained by providing information about inputs. The weight vector of the unit is closest to the current object becomes the winning or active unit. During the training stage, the values for the input variables are gradually adjusted in an attempt to preserve neighborhood relationships that exist within the input data set. As it gets closer to the input object, the weights of the winning unit are adjusted as well as its neighbors.

Teuvo Kohonen writes "The SOM is a new, effective software tool for the visualization of high-dimensional data. It converts complex, nonlinear statistical relationsihps between high-dimensional data items into simple geometric relationships on a low-dimensional display. As it thereby compresses information while preserving the most important topological and metric relationships of the primary data items on the display, it may also be thought to produce some kind of abstractions."
